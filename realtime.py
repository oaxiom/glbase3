        sample_descriptor_tables (Required, or None)
            If set to None, then it will attempt to collect the sample names and primer names from inside the 
            expression_sheets
        
            A set of descriptors that explain what the sample and primer names are. 
            
            If the primer and sample names are correctly labelled in the expression_sheets files,
            then set this to None and it will collect that data from the expression_sheets
            
            It should look like this (a tsv file):
            
            Sample Name Cell Name
            S01 Cell_1

            A02 OTX2
            A03 SNAI1
            ...
    
            Note that the expression_sheets and samples_descriptor_tables are paired, and 
            
            len(expression_sheets) == len(samples_descriptor_tables)
                    
        missing_data_ct (Optional, default=35)
            A Ct value to input into missing data values.
        
        cull_samples_with_low_control_genes (Optional, default=20)
            remove samples where the Ct in the control_genes is >20 (by default)
            
            If you have more than 1 control_gene, both genes must pass this threshold.
            
        prefix (Optional, default=None)
            add a prefix to the 'sample names' to help in discriminating samples
       
        omit_samples (Optional, default=None)
            send a list of names to exclude from the analysis. Testing is done using 'in'
            so you can also add prefix's etc. Designed so you can omit samples such as
            'negative control' etc.
        
        convert_under_scores (Optional, default=False)
            convert underscores i.e. '_' in the sample names to spaces
        
        method (Required)
            The normalisation method required.
            
            Currently three methods are implemented:
            
            'Mean' - just mean the replicates.
            'Buganim' - implements the normalisation procedure from Buganim et al., 2012; Cell.
            None - This is primarily a debug routine to see all of the values in the Ct. You probably don't want to use this.
        
        control_genes (Required if method=="Buganim")
            You must specify one ore more control primers if the method is 'Buganim'
        
        use_pass_fail (Optional, default=True)
            Use the pass/fail calls from the BioMark.
