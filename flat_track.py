  that would throw an error in __Get_block()

        """
        **Purpose**
            Draw a set of pileup count scores (averages or cumulative scores)

        **Arguments**
            genelists
                A list of genelist with a "loc" key

            filename
                The filename to save the image to

            window_size (Optional, default=None)
                the number of base pairs to use around the centre of the location
                If set to None then it will use the location as specified.

            average (Optional, default=True)
                use the average score if set to True (i.e. divide by the number of items)
                Or use the cumulative score (the total) if set to False

            background (Optional)
                You can supply a list of background coordinates if you want. The lists
                must contain a "loc" key.

            mask_zero (Optional, default=False)
                flat_tracks are continuous and must have a value at all base pairs. I fill
                that value with 0
                However, in some flat_tracks 0 actually means 'no data' and I want to ignore
                those values in the pileup. If that is the case for you, set mask_zero to
                True.

            <other graph-related args>
            pileup also respects:
                xlabel - x-axis label
                ylabel - y-axis label
                title  - title

            respect_strand (Optional, default=False)
                If available, respect the orientation of the strand from the genelist.
                This is useful if you are, say, using the TSS's and want to maintain the
                orientation with respect to the transcription direction.

            norm_by_read_count (Optional, default=False)
                If you are not using a norm_factor for this library then you probably want to set this to True.
                It will divide the resulting number of reads by the total number of reads,
                i.e. it will account for differences in library sizes.

        **Returns**
            (data, back)
            The data from the line graph.
            back will be the average of the list of background peaks, but data
            will be the last entry in the peaklists (if a list of peaks) or will correspond to the
            only peaklist provided. e.g.:

            data, back = pileup(genelists=[data1, data2, THISDATAWILLBERETURNED] ...)
